# hello-world
My very first repository

Hi everyone,

my name is Alfredo Moreno Mart√≠nez and I am currently on my journey to become a software developer. I hold a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and started learning to program with C and C++. Later on, I realized the importance of the web as the most widely used software platform in the world and started learning the web stack. Right now I am transitioning from taking tutorials into making projects because it is the only way to develop the necessary skills to become a real world software engineer solving real problems.
